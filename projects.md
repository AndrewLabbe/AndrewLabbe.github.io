# Projects
## [Calculator](https://github.com/AndrewLabbe/Calculator)
This was one of my github projects that I made of a basic calculator program that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides. I used Java to program this and it was a relatively simple program, reading in user input to use one of the operations on two given numbers.

## [Scene Project](https://github.com/AndrewLabbe/SceneProject)
This is another of my github projects that I created which uses the wheels package to display a city skyline. I used java to code this project and the wheels package to display the image. It consists of a bunch of rectangles and ellipses to create a city skyline. A big challenge of creating this was using trial-and-error to determine where each shape should be placed respective to another.

## [Washing App](https://github.com/AndrewLabbe/WashingApp)
This is another of my github projects that I created with a couple others to mock an App that tracks what washers and dryers are done in a Quinnipiac dorm. We used Java to program this and we all used Eclipse to evade any code sharing errors when pulling down from master. Probably the biggest challenge with this project was working together asynchronously and resolving merge conflicts when they occured.
