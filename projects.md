## [Snake Game](https://github.com/AndrewLabbe/Calculator)
My favorite program that I have developed is a replica of Google's infamous "snake" game. When run, the user controls a "snake" made up of green rectangle segments to collect red rectangles around the window which are assumed to be "apples." When the snake's head interacts with the apple, a new rectangle segment is added to the tail. When the snake's head runs into the borders of the window or one of its segments, the game ends. The user can change the difficulty of the game before starting (changing how fast the snake moves) and can restart the game when they lose. The README section of this project contains more information about the program. A definite struggle when programming this game was checking with each frame of the program whether the head segment has interacted with other segments to end the game. 

## [Interactive Scene](https://github.com/AndrewLabbe/SceneProject)
Above is a java project that I created to display a city skyline. The program is designed to be interactable by making the buildings, background and sun react to user input by using the java swing package. The README section of this project contains more information about the program. The objective of this program was to create an interactive scene that incorporates the swing package and other programming techniques. By implementing interface polymorphism and association, I strengthened such techniques which are essential in object-oriented programming environments.
